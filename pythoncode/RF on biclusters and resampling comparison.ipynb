However, because the SMOTE algorithm uses the nearest neighbors of observations to create synthetic data, it still bleeds information. If the nearest neighbors of minority class observations in the training set end up in the validation set, their information is partially captured by the synthetic data in the training set. Since I’m splitting the data randomly, we’d expect to have this happen. As a result, the model will be better able to predict validation set values than completely new data.\n",
